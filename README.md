## Brief
The goal of this project was to create an app that consists of 4 services. Serivce 1 serves as the front end with which the user interacts, and accepts responses from the other 3 services.

## My Idea
The idea that I came up with was to design a service that takes a continent and a class of creature and returns a creature of that class from that continent.
* Front End (service 1): The user interacts with this service to send requests to the other services to generate a random creature.
* Creature Type: Receives a GET request from service 1 and chooses a type of creature from a list.
* Continent: Receives a GET request from service 1 and chooses the continent which the creature is from from a list
* Creature Name: Receives a post request from service 1 and outputs a creature of the chosen type from the chosen continent.
